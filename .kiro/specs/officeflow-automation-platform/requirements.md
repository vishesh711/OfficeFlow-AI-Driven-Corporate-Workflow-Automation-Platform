# Requirements Document

## Introduction

OfficeFlow is an event-driven orchestration platform that automates recurring corporate workflows such as employee onboarding, access management, document distribution, and offboarding processes. The system uses Kafka for event streaming, microservices for execution, and AI for adaptive decision-making to transform manual, error-prone HR/IT processes into automated, compliant workflows.

## Glossary

- **OfficeFlow_Platform**: The complete event-driven workflow automation system
- **Workflow_Engine**: The core orchestration service that manages workflow execution
- **Node_Executor**: Individual microservices that perform specific workflow tasks
- **Workflow_DAG**: Directed Acyclic Graph representing the sequence and dependencies of workflow nodes
- **Lifecycle_Event**: Kafka events that trigger workflows (e.g., employee.onboard, employee.exit)
- **AI_Node**: Specialized workflow nodes that use LLMs for adaptive content generation
- **Workflow_Designer**: React-based visual interface for creating and editing workflows
- **HRMS_Adapter**: Service that normalizes HR system events into standard lifecycle events

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an HR administrator, I want to create visual workflows for employee onboarding, so that I can automate repetitive tasks and ensure consistent processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an HR administrator accesses the workflow designer, THE Workflow_Designer SHALL display a drag-and-drop interface with available node types
2. WHEN an HR administrator connects workflow nodes, THE Workflow_Designer SHALL validate dependencies and prevent circular references
3. WHEN an HR administrator saves a workflow, THE OfficeFlow_Platform SHALL store the workflow definition as a JSON DAG in the database
4. WHERE workflow templates are available, THE Workflow_Designer SHALL allow administrators to clone and modify existing workflows
5. THE Workflow_Designer SHALL export workflow definitions that include node parameters, dependencies, and execution conditions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As the system, I want to automatically execute workflows when lifecycle events occur, so that corporate processes run without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a lifecycle event is published to Kafka, THE Workflow_Engine SHALL identify and load the corresponding workflow definition
2. WHEN a workflow is loaded, THE Workflow_Engine SHALL perform topological sorting to determine node execution order
3. WHILE a workflow is executing, THE Workflow_Engine SHALL dispatch eligible nodes to their respective Node_Executor services
4. WHEN a node completes execution, THE Workflow_Engine SHALL update workflow state and trigger dependent nodes
5. IF a node execution fails, THEN THE Workflow_Engine SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an IT administrator, I want to provision and deprovision user accounts automatically, so that access management is secure and compliant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an employee onboarding event occurs, THE Node_Executor SHALL create corporate email accounts using configured identity providers
2. WHEN an employee exit event occurs, THE Node_Executor SHALL disable all associated accounts and revoke access permissions
3. WHILE provisioning accounts, THE Node_Executor SHALL assign appropriate groups and permissions based on employee role and department
4. THE Node_Executor SHALL integrate with identity providers including Okta, Google Workspace, and Office 365
5. WHEN account operations complete, THE Node_Executor SHALL log all actions for audit compliance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an employee, I want to receive personalized onboarding communications, so that I feel welcomed and have the information I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN onboarding workflows execute, THE AI_Node SHALL generate personalized welcome messages using employee profile data
2. WHEN documents are distributed, THE Node_Executor SHALL send role-specific onboarding materials and policy documents
3. WHEN meetings are scheduled, THE Node_Executor SHALL automatically book introduction calls with managers and team members
4. THE AI_Node SHALL use LLM services to create contextually appropriate content based on employee department and role
5. WHEN communications are sent, THE Node_Executor SHALL track delivery status and log interactions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want complete audit trails of all workflow executions, so that I can demonstrate regulatory compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any workflow executes, THE OfficeFlow_Platform SHALL log all node executions with timestamps and outcomes
2. WHEN workflows complete, THE OfficeFlow_Platform SHALL store immutable audit records in the database
3. WHILE workflows are running, THE OfficeFlow_Platform SHALL track state changes and maintain execution history
4. THE OfficeFlow_Platform SHALL provide audit reports showing workflow execution details and compliance metrics
5. WHEN audit data is accessed, THE OfficeFlow_Platform SHALL enforce role-based access controls and log access attempts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the platform to scale horizontally, so that it can handle increasing workflow volumes without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflow volume increases, THE OfficeFlow_Platform SHALL distribute load across multiple Workflow_Engine instances
2. WHEN node execution demand grows, THE Node_Executor services SHALL scale independently using container orchestration
3. WHILE processing events, THE OfficeFlow_Platform SHALL partition Kafka topics by organization and employee identifiers
4. THE OfficeFlow_Platform SHALL maintain stateless orchestration services that can be deployed across multiple instances
5. WHEN system resources are constrained, THE OfficeFlow_Platform SHALL implement backpressure mechanisms and circuit breakers

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a business user, I want workflows to handle failures gracefully, so that critical processes complete even when individual steps fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a node fails after maximum retries, THE Workflow_Engine SHALL execute fallback nodes if defined in the workflow
2. WHEN workflows encounter errors, THE OfficeFlow_Platform SHALL implement compensation flows to rollback completed actions
3. WHILE workflows are paused or cancelled, THE Workflow_Engine SHALL maintain state checkpoints for resumption
4. THE OfficeFlow_Platform SHALL route failed messages to dead letter queues for manual review and reprocessing
5. WHEN system components are unavailable, THE OfficeFlow_Platform SHALL ensure message durability through Kafka persistence

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an integration specialist, I want to connect with existing enterprise systems, so that workflows can leverage current infrastructure and data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with HRMS systems, THE HRMS_Adapter SHALL normalize events from Workday, SuccessFactors, and BambooHR
2. WHEN connecting to communication platforms, THE Node_Executor SHALL integrate with Slack, Microsoft Teams, and email systems
3. WHILE accessing calendar systems, THE Node_Executor SHALL schedule meetings using Google Calendar and Office 365 APIs
4. THE OfficeFlow_Platform SHALL support OAuth2.0 authentication for secure API integrations
5. WHEN external systems are unavailable, THE Node_Executor SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns and graceful degradation
