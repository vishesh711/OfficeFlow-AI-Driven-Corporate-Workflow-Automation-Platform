## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of OfficeFlow seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to:
- **Security Team**: security@officeflow.com (or your actual contact email)

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of vulnerability (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

After you submit a vulnerability report, we will:

1. Confirm the receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
2. Send you regular updates about our progress
3. Work with you to understand and validate the vulnerability
4. Notify you when the vulnerability is fixed
5. Publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Security Update Policy

- Security updates are released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is confirmed
- Critical vulnerabilities are patched within 7 days
- High severity vulnerabilities are patched within 30 days
- Medium/Low severity vulnerabilities are patched in the next regular release

## Security Best Practices for Deployments

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use strong JWT secrets (minimum 32 characters)
- Enable MFA for all admin accounts
- Regularly rotate API keys and tokens
- Implement proper RBAC policies

### Infrastructure Security
- Keep Kubernetes and all dependencies up to date
- Use network policies to restrict inter-service communication
- Enable pod security policies
- Regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities
- Use secrets management (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets, HashiCorp Vault)

### Database Security
- Use strong database passwords
- Enable SSL/TLS for database connections
- Regularly backup databases with encryption
- Restrict database access to specific IP ranges
- Use read-only replicas where appropriate

### Network Security
- Enable HTTPS/TLS for all external communications
- Use valid SSL certificates
- Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Configure WAF (Web Application Firewall) rules
- Use VPN or private networks for sensitive communications

### Monitoring & Logging
- Enable audit logging for all services
- Monitor for suspicious activities
- Set up alerts for security events
- Regularly review access logs
- Implement log retention policies

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Encrypt data in transit
- Implement data masking for PII in logs
- Follow data retention and deletion policies
- Comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other regulations

## Known Security Considerations

### Environment Variables
Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords, tokens) to the repository. Use environment variables or secrets management systems.

### Dependencies
We regularly scan our dependencies for known vulnerabilities using:
- npm audit
- Snyk
- Dependabot
- Trivy

### Container Security
All container images are:
- Built from official base images
- Scanned for vulnerabilities before deployment
- Run as non-root users
- Use multi-stage builds to minimize attack surface

## Security Features

### Built-in Security Features
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API rate limiting
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)

### Compliance
- GDPR compliant
- SOC 2 controls implemented
- Audit logging for compliance
- Data encryption at rest and in transit

## Security Changelog

### Version 1.0.0 (Current)
- Initial security implementation
- JWT authentication
- RBAC authorization
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- Container security hardening
- Kubernetes security policies
