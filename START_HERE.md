# üöÄ Quick Start Guide - OfficeFlow Platform

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop (running)
- Node.js 18+ and pnpm
- PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka (via Docker)

## Step 1: Start Infrastructure

```bash
# Start all Docker services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, MinIO)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Wait ~10 seconds for services to be ready
```

## Step 2: Run All Application Services

### Option A: Use the startup script (Recommended)
```bash
./start-all.sh
```

### Option B: Manual command
```bash
pnpm run dev \
  --filter="@officeflow/auth-service" \
  --filter="@officeflow/workflow-engine" \
  --filter="@officeflow/workflow-designer" \
  --filter="@officeflow/ai-service"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Services Not Starting?

1. **Check Docker is running**:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
   You should see: postgres, redis, zookeeper, kafka, minio

2. **Check if ports are available**:
   ```bash
   lsof -i :3000  # Workflow Engine
   lsof -i :3001  # Auth Service
   lsof -i :3003  # AI Service
   lsof -i :5173  # Frontend
   ```

3. **Kill existing processes**:
   ```bash
   pkill -f "tsx watch"
   pkill -f "vite"
   ```

### Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env` file in the root directory contains:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://officeflow:officeflow_dev@localhost:5432/officeflow
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
KAFKA_BROKER_URL=localhost:9092
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Registration Fails?

- Make sure the **Auth Service (port 3001)** is running
- Check the terminal for error messages
- Verify PostgreSQL is accessible

### Can't Create Workflows?

- Make sure the **Workflow Engine (port 3000)** is running
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify you're logged in

## Development

### View Logs

All services log to the terminal. You'll see:
- `@officeflow/auth-service:dev` - Authentication logs
- `@officeflow/workflow-engine:dev` - Workflow execution logs  
- `@officeflow/ai-service:dev` - AI service logs
- `@officeflow/workflow-designer:dev` - Frontend (Vite) logs

### Stop Services

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where services are running.

To stop Docker services:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
```

## Next Steps
