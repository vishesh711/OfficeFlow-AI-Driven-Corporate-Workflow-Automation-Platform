# Template Modification Guide 🔧

## Common Issues When Modifying Templates

When you modify a template, you might encounter validation errors. Here's how to fix them!

---

## ✅ Validation Requirements

Every workflow must have:

### 1. **At Least One Trigger Node**
- Every workflow needs a starting point
- Use "Event Trigger" or "Schedule" node
- Trigger should be connected to other nodes

### 2. **All Nodes Connected**
- Nodes must form a connected path from trigger
- No isolated/floating nodes (unless warnings are OK)
- No circular connections (A → B → A)

### 3. **Required Fields Filled**

**Email Node:**
- ✅ Recipients (who gets the email)
- ✅ Template (what email to send)

**Condition Node:**
- ✅ Expression (what to check)

**Delay Node:**
- ✅ Duration (at least 1 unit)

**Identity Node:**
- ✅ Action (provision/deprovision)
- ✅ Provider (google/okta/etc)

**AI Node:**
- ✅ Content Type (what to generate)

## 🔍 **Common Errors & Fixes**

### Error: "Workflow must have at least one trigger node"

**Problem:** You deleted the trigger node

**Fix:**
1. Drag "Event Trigger" from sidebar
2. Connect it to your first action node

---

### Error: "Email node has no recipients configured"

**Problem:** Email node is missing recipient email address

**Fix:**
1. Click on the Email node
2. In Properties Panel (right side)
3. Fill in "Recipients" field
   - Example: `{{employee.email}}`
   - Or: `hr@company.com`

---

### Error: "Email node has no template selected"

**Problem:** Email node doesn't know what email to send

**Fix:**
1. Click on the Email node
2. In Properties Panel
3. Select a template from dropdown
   - `welcome` - Welcome email
   - `exit` - Exit email
   - etc.

---

### Error: "Node X is not connected to the workflow"

**Problem:** You have a floating node that's not connected

**Fix:**
1. Connect the node to your workflow
   - Drag from bottom circle of source node
   - Drop on top circle of target node
2. OR delete the node if you don't need it
   - Select node and press Delete key

---

### Error: "Node X is not reachable from any trigger"

**Problem:** Node is connected but can't be reached from trigger

**Fix:**
1. Trace path from trigger
2. Make sure there's a connection path to this node
3. Check for disconnected sections

---

### Error: "Circular dependency detected"

**Problem:** Nodes form a loop (A → B → C → A)

**Fix:**
1. Delete one of the circular connections
2. Workflows must flow forward, not in circles
3. Use the validation panel to see which nodes are in the loop

## 🎯 **Step-by-Step: Modify a Template**

### Example: Customize "Employee Onboarding" Template

1. **Select Template**
   ```
   Templates → Employee Onboarding → Use Template
   ```

2. **Template Loads**
   ```
   Trigger → Identity → Email → Slack
   ```

3. **Make Your Changes**
   
   **Add a Delay:**
   ```
   - Drag "Delay" node
   - Place between Email and Slack
   - Connect: Email → Delay → Slack
   - Set delay to 1 hour
   ```

   **Change Email Template:**
   ```
   - Click Email node
   - In Properties Panel
   - Change template from "welcome" to "custom_welcome"
   ```

   **Remove Slack (if not needed):**
   ```
   - Select Slack node
   - Press Delete key
   - Now: Trigger → Identity → Email → Delay
   ```

4. **Validate**
   ```
   - Check for validation errors (bottom right)
   - Fix any red errors
   - Warnings (yellow) are OK to ignore
   ```

5. **Save**
   ```
   - Click "Save" button
   - Fix any errors shown
   - Success!
   ```

6. **Test**
   ```
   - Click "Test Run"
   - Monitor execution
   ```

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

### Tip 1: Use Validation Panel

**How:**
1. Look at bottom right of screen
2. Click validation panel if it appears
3. Click on errors to jump to problem nodes

### Tip 2: Check Required Fields

**Before Saving:**
1. Click each node
2. Check Properties Panel (right)
3. Make sure all required fields are filled
4. Look for red asterisks (*)

### Tip 3: Test Connections

**Good Connection:**
```
[Trigger]
    ↓
  [Email]
    ↓
  [Slack]
```

**Bad Connection (disconnected):**
```
[Trigger]     [Email]
    ↓            ↓
              [Slack]
```

### Tip 4: Save Often

**Workflow:**
```
Make change → Save → Test → Repeat
```

Don't make many changes at once without saving!
