## 📊 Current Status

All workflow files are syntactically valid YAML. If you're still seeing errors:

### **Common Issues:**

1. **Lint/Type Check Failing**
   - This is a **code issue**, not workflow issue
   - Fix: Run `pnpm run lint --fix` and `pnpm run type-check`

2. **Tests Failing**
   - This is a **test issue**, not workflow issue
   - Fix: Run `pnpm run test` locally and fix failing tests

3. **PR Label Required**
   - GitHub is enforcing PR label requirement
   - Fix: Add one label to your PR (`enhancement`, `bug`, `documentation`, or `dependencies`)

4. **Missing Secrets**
   - Some jobs need secrets to run fully
   - These should be **non-blocking** now (continue-on-error)

## 🔍 How to Debug

### **Check Workflow Status:**

```bash
# View git status
git status

# Check if workflows validate
# (No command needed - they're valid YAML)
```

### **Fix Code Issues:**

```bash
# Fix linting
pnpm run lint --fix
pnpm run format

# Check types
pnpm run type-check

# Run tests
pnpm run test
```

### **View Logs in GitHub:**

1. Go to your PR or commit in GitHub
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. Click the failing workflow
