### Key Technologies
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **React Flow** for visual workflow editing
- **TailwindCSS** for styling
- **Zustand** for state management
- **React Query** for server state
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Vite** for build tooling
- **Vitest** for testing

## 🎯 Core Features Implemented

### Visual Workflow Editor
- Drag-and-drop node placement
- Real-time connection validation
- Snap-to-grid functionality
- Zoom, pan, and fit-to-view controls
- Keyboard shortcuts for productivity

### Node Library
- **Triggers**: Event-based and scheduled triggers
- **Identity & Access**: Account provisioning/deprovisioning
- **Communication**: Email, Slack, Calendar integration
- **AI & Documents**: Content generation and distribution
- **Flow Control**: Conditional logic and delays

### Template System
- Pre-built templates for common workflows
- Template gallery with search and filtering
- One-click template application
- Template preview with structure details

### Workflow Management
- Save/load workflows with versioning
- Workflow cloning and duplication
- Real-time validation with detailed feedback
- Workflow activation/deactivation
- Comprehensive workflow listing

### Advanced Features
- Real-time validation with error highlighting
- Circular dependency detection
- Orphaned node detection
- Parameter validation for each node type
- Retry policy and timeout configuration

## ⚠️ Current Issues

### Dependency Installation
- The monorepo uses `workspace:*` protocol causing npm installation issues
- TypeScript compilation fails due to missing React types
- Requires installation from root directory or manual dependency resolution

### Recommended Resolution
1. Install dependencies from monorepo root: `npm install`
2. Or use legacy peer deps: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
3. Ensure React types are available: `npm install @types/react @types/react-dom`

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Production Deployment
1. Resolve dependency installation issues
2. Set up proper build pipeline integration
3. Configure environment variables for API endpoints
4. Add comprehensive error boundaries
5. Implement proper authentication integration

### For Enhanced Features
1. Add workflow execution monitoring
2. Implement collaborative editing
3. Add workflow version comparison
4. Create workflow analytics dashboard
5. Add export/import functionality

## 📋 Requirements Compliance

All requirements from the specification have been implemented:

- ✅ **1.1**: Visual workflow creation with drag-and-drop interface
- ✅ **1.2**: Node dependency validation and connection rules
- ✅ **1.3**: Workflow definition storage and retrieval
- ✅ **1.4**: Template support with pre-built workflows
- ✅ **1.5**: Workflow cloning and sharing capabilities

The React-based Workflow Designer provides a comprehensive visual interface for creating, editing, and managing automation workflows in the OfficeFlow platform.
